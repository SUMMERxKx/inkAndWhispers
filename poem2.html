        <div class="poem-text">
            <p>
                She wasn't love at first sight, no spark,<br>
                But something about her left a mark.<br>
                Her presence, bright yet cold, held sway,<br>
                And drew me in, like a moth to a flame's play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not love, no—just an attraction fierce,<br>
                A force too strong for me to pierce.<br>
                Her smile, a puzzle, real or fake,<br>
                Her aura a power, no room could forsake.
            </p>
            <p>
                She owned the space, a queen of grace,<br>
                Her beauty, unmatched, time couldn't erase.<br>
                I wonder, is it bias that I speak?<br>
                Or is she the rarest treasure I seek?
            </p>
            <p>
                She seemed the piece I'd been missing,<br>
                The story's twist, the ending's blessing.<br>
                The last piece of the pie, the final link,<br>
                The thing that made everything perfect, I think.
            </p>
            <p>
                We shared common ground, shared laughter, fights,<br>
                But never tears, those hidden nights.<br>
                Why the happy moments, yet no sorrow to share?<br>
                Was it because I didn't want pity to be there?
            </p>
            <p>
                Love born of pity is hollow, I knew,<br>
                Been there before, it never rings true.<br>
                So I let her go, let her find her way,<br>
                She's the one in charge, I'll obey.
            </p>
            <p>
                A pawn, I felt, in her grand game,<br>
                But the love I felt was never the same.<br>
                It wasn't pity, not a shred of it,<br>
                It was love that burned in every bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always gave more, I always cared,<br>
                Knew in my soul I'd always be there.<br>
                To die for her, in a second, I would,<br>
                But love's question lingered, misunderstood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why did I fall? Was it her light?<br>
                Her presence calm, her soul so bright.<br>
                Was it knowing she'd always stand tall,<br>
                And love me, even when I fall?
            </p>
            <p>
                She's pure and fiery, a force of her own,<br>
                A love like none I've ever known.<br>
                But words unspoken, they stay inside,<br>
                A truth I carry, a secret I hide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet if I ever regret a thing,<br>
                It's not saying it, the joy it could bring.<br>
                Remember this, should time ever part,<br>
                My heart will hold you, though arms may not start.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all my dreams of life's perfect view,<br>
                One thing remains—the constant truth:<br>
                You.
            </p>

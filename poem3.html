            <p>
                The clouds had finally drifted away,<br>
                The stars bright enough to challenge the bay,<br>
                The scent of wet grass in the night,<br>
                But he, too tired, ignored the sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                He'd seen this view a thousand times,<br>
                Now lost in his thoughts, tangled in rhymes.<br>
                "Why stress about life?" he thought with a sigh,<br>
                When his peers lived freely, spirits high.
            </p>
            <p>
                His parents weren't poor, but not quite enough,<br>
                For the lifestyle his friends called "tough."<br>
                He felt guilty for wanting more,<br>
                When others had so much less in store.
            </p>
            <p>
                He closed his eyes, tried to sleep,<br>
                Hoping for answers buried deep.<br>
                "Will I ever be happy, content, or free?<br>
                And if I am, where will it be?"
            </p>
            <p>
                But the night stretched long and full of weight,<br>
                The questions lingered, sealing his fate.<br>
                His mind spun round in endless flight,<br>
                With no answers found, just the quiet of night.
            </p>
